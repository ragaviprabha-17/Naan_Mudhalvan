# Time-Series Forecasting with Autoencoder Neural Networks

## Project Overview
The project aims to predict future values in time-series data using autoencoder neural networks. It generates synthetic time-series data, designs and trains an autoencoder model, and applies it to generate future sequences.

## Utilization
- **Generate Time-Series Data:** The `generate_time_series_data` function creates synthetic time-series data with two sine waves and random noise.
- **Create Autoencoder Model:** The `create_autoencoder` function defines an autoencoder model architecture using LSTM layers to capture temporal patterns in the data.
- **Train Autoencoder Model:** The `train_autoencoder` function trains the autoencoder model using the generated time-series data, aiming to minimize the mean squared error loss between input and output sequences.
- **Generate New Sequence:** The `generate_new_sequence` function uses the trained autoencoder to generate a new sequence of future data points based on a seed sequence.
- **Plot Results:** The `main` function orchestrates the entire process, from data generation to model training and sequence generation. It visualizes the original seed sequence and the generated future sequence for comparison.

## Usage Scenario
This project is applicable in various domains such as financial forecasting, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance, where accurate prediction of future trends and patterns in time-series data is essential for decision-making. Users can customize the provided code to their specific needs by adjusting parameters like the length of the time-series data or the architecture of the autoencoder model.

## Value Proposition
The project involves generating synthetic time-series data, building and training an autoencoder model, and assessing its performance. Its value proposition lies in the autoencoder's ability to capture temporal patterns within the data and provide accurate predictions of future values. This solution offers insights into future trends and behaviors, enabling informed decision-making across sectors such as finance, energy, and healthcare.
